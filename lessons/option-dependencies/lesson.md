# Option dependencies

Now we have some basic knowledge of how to create an option and set its value with a config.
But previously, we created an option that was both the input and output.
What if we want several inputs and a output that is some combination of those inputs?

That is completely possible!

Options can depend on other options, making it possible to build more useful abstractions.
To make option values available to a module, the arguments of the function declaring the module must include the `config` attribute.

!!! note
    Lazy evaluation in the Nix language allows the module system to make a value available in the config argument passed to the module which defines that value.

[//]: # (./options.nix)

As you can see, we have added `config` to the function argument of the `options.nix` module.
We have also declared `name`, `title`,  and `origin` which are all `str` types.
Those will be our inputs that will we configure.

We have also declared an option, `greeting`, which is also a `str` type.
In the same file, we have defined its value using the final configuration values of the other options.

!!! note
    The line `cfg = config;` is not strictly necessary.
    We could have used the `config` argument wherever `cfg` was used.
    However, it does help mentally separate the idea of the config *argument* and the config *attribute*.
    If you explore the NixOS modules, you will find more interesting examples of this pattern.

!!! warning
    The `config` *argument* is not the same as the `config` attribute:

    - The `config` *argument* holds the result of the module system’s lazy evaluation,
    which takes into account all modules passed to `evalModules` and their `imports`.
    - The `config` *attribute* of a module exposes that particular module’s option values to the module system for evaluation.

So now we just set values for `name`, `title`, and `origin` in `config.nix` like we have done before.

[//]: # (./config.nix)

Setup an `eval.nix` to evaluate our modules and return the `config` attribute.

[//]: # (./eval.nix)

Create a `run.sh` run script to evalute the `eval.nix` file.

[//]: # (./run.sh)

And if we run the script (`./run.sh`), we have our configuration.

[//]: # (self.eval)

Notice that it gave use the entire configuration, which is to be expected.
What if we just want `greeting`?

We can specify to only return the `greeting` attribute in our new `eval-greeting.nix` file.

[//]: # (./eval-greeting.nix)

Update our run script as shown in `run-greeting.sh`.

[//]: # (./run-greeting.sh)

And if we run the new script (`./run-greeting.sh`), we have just the configuration of `greeting`.

[//]: # (self.eval-greeting)
